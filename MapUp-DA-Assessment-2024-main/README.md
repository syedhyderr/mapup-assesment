# Python Section 1

## Question 1: Reverse List by N Elements

**Problem Statement**:

Write a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, and returns the list with every group of `n` elements reversed. If there are fewer than `n` elements left at the end, reverse all of them.

**Requirements**:
1. You must not use any built-in slicing or reverse functions to directly reverse the sublists.
2. The result should reverse the elements in groups of size `n`.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, `n=3`
  - **Output**: `[3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7]`

- **Input**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `n=2`
  - **Output**: `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`

- **Input**: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]`, `n=4`
  - **Output**: `[40, 30, 20, 10, 70, 60, 50]`


## Question 2: Lists & Dictionaries

**Problem Statement**:

Write a function that takes a list of strings and groups them by their length. The result should be a dictionary where:
- The keys are the string lengths.
- The values are lists of strings that have the same length as the key.

**Requirements**:
1. Each string should appear in the list corresponding to its length.
2. The result should be sorted by the lengths (keys) in ascending order.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `["apple", "bat", "car", "elephant", "dog", "bear"]`
  - **Output**: `{3: ['bat', 'car', 'dog'], 4: ['bear'], 5: ['apple'], 8: ['elephant']}`

- **Input**: `["one", "two", "three", "four"]`
  - **Output**: `{3: ['one', 'two'], 4: ['four'], 5: ['three']}`


## Question 3: Flatten a Nested Dictionary

You are given a nested dictionary that contains various details (including lists and sub-dictionaries). Your task is to write a Python function that flattens the dictionary such that:

- **Nested keys** are concatenated into a single key with levels separated by a dot (`.`).
- **List elements** should be referenced by their index, enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `sections[0]`).
  
For example, if a key points to a list, the index of the list element should be appended to the key string, followed by a dot to handle further nested dictionaries.

**Requirements**:

1. **Nested Dictionary**: Flatten nested dictionaries into a single level, concatenating keys.
2. **Handling Lists**: Flatten lists by using the index as part of the key.
3. **Key Separator**: Use a dot (`.`) as a separator between nested key levels.
4. **Empty Input**: The function should handle empty dictionaries gracefully.
5. **Nested Depth**: You can assume the dictionary has a maximum of 4 levels of nesting.

**Example**:

**Input**:

```json
{
    "road": {
        "name": "Highway 1",
        "length": 350,
        "sections": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "condition": {
                    "pavement": "good",
                    "traffic": "moderate"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```json
{
    "road.name": "Highway 1",
    "road.length": 350,
    "road.sections[0].id": 1,
    "road.sections[0].condition.pavement": "good",
    "road.sections[0].condition.traffic": "moderate"
}
```

## Question 4: Generate Unique Permutations

**Problem Statement**:

You are given a list of integers that may contain duplicates. Your task is to generate all **unique** permutations of the list. The output should not contain any duplicate permutations.

**Example**:

**Input**:
```json
[1, 1, 2]
```

**Output**:
```json
[
    [1, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 1, 1]
]
```

## Question 5: Find All Dates in a Text

**Problem Statement**:

You are given a string that contains dates in various formats (such as "dd-mm-yyyy", "mm/dd/yyyy", "yyyy.mm.dd", etc.). Your task is to identify and return all the valid dates present in the string.

You need to write a function `find_all_dates` that takes a string as input and returns a list of valid dates found in the text. The dates can be in any of the following formats:
- `dd-mm-yyyy`
- `mm/dd/yyyy`
- `yyyy.mm.dd`

You are required to use **regular expressions** to identify these dates.

**Example**:

**Input**:
```json
text = "I was born on 23-08-1994, my friend on 08/23/1994, and another one on 1994.08.23."
```
**Output**:
```json
["23-08-1994", "08/23/1994", "1994.08.23"]
```

## Question 6: Decode Polyline, Convert to DataFrame with Distances

You are given a polyline string, which encodes a series of latitude and longitude coordinates. Polyline encoding is a method to efficiently store latitude and longitude data using fewer bytes. The Python `polyline` module allows you to decode this string into a list of coordinates.

Write a function that performs the following operations:
1. **Decode the polyline** string using the `polyline` module into a list of (latitude, longitude) coordinates.
2. **Convert these coordinates into a Pandas DataFrame** with the following columns:
   - `latitude`: Latitude of the coordinate.
   - `longitude`: Longitude of the coordinate.
   - `distance`: The distance (in meters) between the current row's coordinate and the previous row's one. The first row will have a distance of `0` since there is no previous point.
3. **Calculate the distance** using the Haversine formula for points in successive rows.

## Question 7: Matrix Rotation and Transformation

Write a function that performs the following operations on a square matrix (n x n):

1. **Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.**
2. **After rotation, for each element in the rotated matrix, replace it with the sum of all elements in the same row and column (in the rotated matrix), excluding itself.**

The function should return the transformed matrix.

### Example

For the input matrix:
```
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
```

Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise:
```
rotated_matrix = [[7, 4, 1],[8, 5, 2],[9, 6, 3]]
```

Replace each element with the sum of all elements in the same row and column, excluding itself:
```
final_matrix = [[22, 19, 16],[23, 20, 17],[24, 21, 18]]
```

## Question 8: Time Check

You are given a dataset, `dataset-1.csv`, containing columns `id`, `id_2`, and timestamp (`startDay`, `startTime`, `endDay`, `endTime`). The goal is to verify the completeness of the time data by checking whether the timestamps for each unique (`id`, `id_2`) pair cover a full 24-hour period (from 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM) and span all 7 days of the week (from Monday to Sunday).

Create a function that accepts `dataset-1.csv` as a DataFrame and returns a boolean series that indicates if each (`id`, `id_2`) pair has incorrect timestamps. The boolean series must have multi-index (`id`, `id_2`).

***(Questions in this section are interrelated, so please solve them accordingly.)***
## Question 9: Distance Matrix Calculation

Create a function named `calculate_distance_matrix` that takes the `dataset-2.csv` as input and generates a DataFrame representing distances between IDs. 

The resulting DataFrame should have cumulative distances along known routes, with diagonal values set to 0. If distances between toll locations A to B and B to C are known, then the distance from A to C should be the sum of these distances. Ensure the matrix is symmetric, accounting for bidirectional distances between toll locations (i.e. A to B is equal to B to A). 

Sample result dataframe:\
 ![Section 2 Question 9](readme_images/section2-q9.png)

## Question 10: Unroll Distance Matrix

Create a function `unroll_distance_matrix` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 9. The resulting DataFrame should have three columns: columns `id_start`, `id_end`, and `distance`.

All the combinations except for same `id_start` to `id_end` must be present in the rows with their distance values from the input DataFrame.

Sample result dataframe:\
 ![Section 2 Question 10](readme_images/section2-q10.png)

## Question 11: Finding IDs within Percentage Threshold

Create a function `find_ids_within_ten_percentage_threshold` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 10 and a reference value from the `id_start` column as an integer.

Calculate average distance for the reference value given as an input and return a sorted list of values from `id_start` column which lie within 10% (including ceiling and floor) of the reference value's average.

## Question 12: Calculate Toll Rate

Create a function `calculate_toll_rate` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 10 as input and calculates toll rates based on vehicle types. 

The resulting DataFrame should add 5 columns to the input DataFrame: `moto`, `car`, `rv`, `bus`, and `truck` with their respective rate coefficients. The toll rates should be calculated by multiplying the distance with the given rate coefficients for each vehicle type: 
- 0.8 for `moto`
- 1.2 for `car`
- 1.5 for `rv`
- 2.2 for `bus`
- 3.6 for `truck`

Sample result dataframe:\
 ![Section 2 Question 12](readme_images/section2-q12.png)

## Question 13: Calculate Time-Based Toll Rates

Create a function named `calculate_time_based_toll_rates` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 12 as input and calculates toll rates for different time intervals within a day. 

The resulting DataFrame should have these five columns added to the input: start_day, start_time, end_day, and end_time.
- `start_day`, `end_day` must be strings with day values (from Monday to Sunday in proper case)
- `start_time` and `end_time` must be of type datetime.time() with the values from time range given below.

Modify the values of vehicle columns according to the following time ranges:

**Weekdays (Monday - Friday):**
- From 00:00:00 to 10:00:00: Apply a discount factor of 0.8
- From 10:00:00 to 18:00:00: Apply a discount factor of 1.2
- From 18:00:00 to 23:59:59: Apply a discount factor of 0.8

**Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
- Apply a constant discount factor of 0.7 for all times.

For each unique (`id_start`, `id_end`) pair, cover a full 24-hour period (from 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM) and span all 7 days of the week (from Monday to Sunday).

Sample result dataframe:\
